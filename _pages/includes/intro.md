Hi! I am a research scientist at Shanghai AI Lab. I got my PhD degree from the University of Hong Kong at the end of 2021, affiliated with the HKU database group and [NLP group](https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/). I am advised by Prof. [Ben Kao](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/kao).
I am also working closely with [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/index.html). Before that, I received my B.E. degree from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/en/) in 2017. 
<!-- Throughout my graduate studies, I had great internships in Tencent AI Lab and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. -->

My research centers around large language models (LLMs) with a special focus on building the next generation of natural language interfaces that can interact with and learn from real-world environments. You can find a prototype of my ambitious goal at [OS-Copilot](https://os-copilot.github.io/).
